# Hangman

### Overview

The goal of Hangman is to guess the word chosen at random. A set of underscores '_' are displayed to show the player the number of letters in the word. 

Each turn the player can input one letter.

The player gets the limited amount of 6 wrong guesses, but as long as the player has not guessed incorrectly can continue guessing until completing the word.

The game ends when either the player makes six wrong guesses or the player completes the word.

although the scribble pictures helped more on my thought process and planning.
